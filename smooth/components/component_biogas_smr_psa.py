This module represents a biogas steam methane reformer that produces hydrogen,
combined with the pressure swing adsorption process to produce 99.9 %
pure hydrogen.

*****
Scope
*****
The primary production of hydrogen is currently from the process
of steam methane reforming (SMR), using natural gas as the feed material. Biogas
can be used as an alternative feed material, which has a similar composition to
natural gas. The utilisation of biogas can be beneficial due to biogas
being a renewable resource, and its usage can lead to less methane emissions
in the atmosphere. Pressure swing adsorption (PSA) is a process used in
combination with SMR to purify the output hydrogen stream to a level of
approximately 99.9 % [1].

*******
Concept
*******
The biogas SMR PSA component takes in a biogas bus and electricity bus as
inputs, with a hydrogen bus output. An oemof Transformer component is
chosen for this component, and is illustrated in Figure 1.

Hydrogen production from SMR
----------------------------
The amount of hydrogen produced in SMR from the chosen composition
of biogas is calculated based on results from [2]. The default amount of
input fuel required to produce 1kg of H2 is 45.977 kWh, and using
this value along with the LHV of biogas, the amount of biogas
required to produce 1kg of H2 is determined:

.. math::
    Bg_{kg H2} = \\frac{fuel_{kg H2}}{LHV_{Bg}}

* :math:`Bg_{kg H2}` = biogas required to produce one kg H2 [kg]
* :math:`fuel_{kg H2}` = specific fuel consumption per kg of H2 produced [kWh/kg]
* :math:`LHV_{Bg}` = heating value of biogas [kWh/kg]

In order to calculate how much hydrogen will be produced in SMR from the input
amount of biogas, the conversion efficiency is calculated:

.. math::
    smr_{eff} = \\frac{1}{Bg_{kg H2}}

* :math:`smr_{eff}` = conversion efficiency of biogas to hydrogen in SMR process [-]

Hydrogen purification with PSA
------------------------------
The hydrogen produced in SMR contains many impurities such as carbon dioxide
and carbon monoxide, and these can be removed using the PSA process.
The default efficiency of the PSA process is taken to be 90 % [3], so the
overall efficiency of the SMR PSA process is determiend by:

.. math::
    overall_{eff} = smr_{eff} \\cdot psa_{eff}

* :math:`overall_{eff}` = overall efficiency of biogas to 99.9 % pure hydrogen in
  SMR and PSA process [-]
* :math:`psa_{eff}` = efficiency of inpure to pure hydrogen is PSA process [-]

Energy consumption
-----------------------
The default energy consumption of the combined SMR and PSA process per kg of
H2 produced is 5.557 kWh/kg [1]. Thus the energy consumption per kg of biogas
 used is:

.. math::
    EC_{kg Bg} = \\frac{5.557}{Bg_{kg H2}} * 1000

* :math:`EC_{kg Bg}` = energy required per kg of biogas used [Wh/kg]
