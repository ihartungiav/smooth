"""
This module represents a stationary battery.

*****
Scope
*****
Batteries are crucial in effectively integrating high shares of renewable
energy electricity sources in diverse energy systems. They can be particularly
useful for off-grid energy systems, or for the management of grid stability
and flexibility. This flexibility is provided to the energy system by the
battery in times where the electric consumers cannot.

*******
Concept
*******
The battery component has an electricity bus input and output, where factors
such as the charging and discharging efficiency, the loss rate, the C-rates
and the depth of discharge define the electricity flows.

Wanted storage level
--------------------
Within this component, there is the possibility to choose a wanted
storage level that the energy system should try to maintain when it
feasibly can. If the state of charge level wanted is defined, the variable
artificial costs change depending on whether the storage level is above or
below the desired value. If the battery level is too low, the artificial
costs of storing electricity into the battery can be reduced and the costs
of extracting electricity from the battery can be increased to incentivise
the system to maintain the wanted storage level.

Maximum chargeable/dischargeable energy
---------------------------------------
The maximum power [W] going in to or out of the battery are dependent on
the C-rate and the capacity:

.. math::
    P_{in,max} = E_{cap} \\cdot C_{r,charge}

    P_{out,max} = E_{cap} \\cdot C_{r,discharge}

* :math:`P_{in,max}` = maximum power flowing from bus to battery [W]
* :math:`E_{cap}` = battery capacity [Wh]
* :math:`C_{r,charge}` = C-Rate for charging [W/Wh]
* :math:`P_{out,max}` = maximum power flowing from battery to bus [W]
* :math:`C_{r,discharge}` = C-Rate for discharging [W/Wh]

    Fig.2: Diagram of the battery component including losses.

The amount of energy that the battery will be charged or discharged
takes the energy losses during the (dis-)charging process into account:

.. math::
    P_{charge,max} = P_{in,max} \\cdot \\mu_{charge}

    P_{out,max} = P_{discharge,max} \\cdot \\mu_{discharge}

* :math:`P_{charge,max}` = maximum chargeable power at the battery [W]
* :math:`\\mu_{charge}` = charging efficiency [-]
* :math:`P_{discharge,max}` = maximum dischargeable power at the battery [W]
* :math:`\\mu_{discharge}` = discharging efficiency [-]
